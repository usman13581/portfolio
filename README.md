## Personal Portfolio (Static Site)

This is a simple, modern single-page portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**.

### Structure

- `index.html` – main page (hero, about, skills, projects, contact)
- `style.css` – layout, colors, typography, and responsive design
- `script.js` – mobile navigation, smooth scrolling, simple contact form behavior

### How to run locally

1. Save all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - On macOS Finder, double-click `index.html`, _or_
   - From a terminal, run something like:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### Customization

Update these in `index.html`:

- Replace **"Your Name"**, initials **"YN"**, and the tagline text.
- Change email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and project links in the **Projects** and **Contact** sections.
- Adjust skills and interests in the **Skills** and **About** sections.
